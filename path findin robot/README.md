# path finding robot


This project implements a **grid-based path planning system** for a robot using **Java**, where users define a grid, place obstacles, and set a start and goal position.
The system uses a **breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm** with custom **queue** and **linked list** implementations to find the shortest path while ensuring valid movement. 
The program provides a **visual representation** of the grid, marking obstacles (`X`), the robot's start position (`R`), the goal (`G`), and the computed path (`P`). 
This project demonstrates **algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and AI-driven navigation**, making it useful for **robotics, AI pathfinding, and simulation applications**. ðŸš€
